# Proof-of-You

**Anonymous Age Verification with Zero-Knowledge Proofs on Solana**

[Live Demo â†’ https://proofofyou.vercel.app](https://proofofyou.vercel.app)

## Overview

Proof-of-You is a privacy-preserving age verification system built on Solana. It uses zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to confirm a user's age without revealing their identity or personal information. This enables secure, anonymous, and decentralized age-gating for DePIN, gaming, and KYC-compliant DeFi applications.

## Features

- **Privacy-First**: Your personal data never leaves your device.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Prove your age without exposing your birthdate.
- **Solana Integration**: Fast, secure, and scalable on-chain verification.
- **Verifiable Credentials**: Issue tamper-proof proof of verification.
