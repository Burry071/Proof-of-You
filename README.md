Proof-of-You — Anonymous Age Verification with ZK Proofs on Solana

Overview

In a world where age verification usually means sharing sensitive personal info, Proof-of-You flips the script.

We're building a privacy-first age verification system powered by zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and verified on Solana.
No documents. No data leaks. Just pure cryptographic trust.


---

What It Does

Users input their date of birth locally — it never leaves their device.

A ZK proof is generated that proves the user is over a specific age.

This proof is verified on-chain using a Solana smart contract.

Users can share their verified status via QR code or private link.


> Think: "Prove you're over 18 without showing your ID — or even your birthdate."

Use Cases

Age-gated websites (alcohol, tobacco, adult content)

Gaming platforms with 13+/18+ rules

Social apps with minor protection

DeFi or DAO participation (lightweight compliance)

DePIN projects with real-world constraints



---

Tech Stack

zk-SNARKs (circom + snarkjs)

Solana (Anchor framework smart contracts)

Next.js + Vercel frontend

Local-only data handling for max privacy

NTT-based credential flow (on the roadmap)



---

Why It Matters

Today’s verification systems are broken — they expose way too much. We’re fixing that with a ZK-native identity flow that respects privacy while maintaining trust.

This project is about decentralized trust without surveillance — built for the real world.


---

What’s Next

Launch NTT (non-transferable token) support

Add custom verifier dashboard

Allow app devs to set their own age thresholds

Expand SDK & API for easy third-party integration
