## 📋 Overview

Proof-of-You is a privacy-preserving age verification system that uses zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to verify a user's age without revealing any personal information or identity. Built on Solana, it provides a secure, transparent, and anonymous way to prove you're above a certain age threshold.

## ✨ Features

- **🔒 Privacy-First**: Your personal information never leaves your device
- **🧮 Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verify your age without revealing your actual birthdate
- **⛓️ Solana Blockchain**: Secure and transparent verification on Solana
- **🚫 No Data Storage**: We don't store any personal data or wallet addresses
- **🕶️ Anonymous**: Complete anonymity throughout the verification process
- **📱 User Dashboard**: Manage and share your verifications
- **🔗 Shareable Proofs**: Generate QR codes and links for verification
- **🧩 Developer API**: Easy integration with existing applications

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Blockchain**: Solana
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: zk-SNARKs
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn/pnpm
- A Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/proof-of-you.git
   cd proof-of-you
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   \`\`\`

3. Start the development server:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   \`\`\`

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Enter Date of Birth**: The user enters their date of birth on their device
2. **Generate Proof**: A zero-knowledge proof is generated locally that proves the user is above a certain age threshold without revealing their actual birthdate
3. **Store on Blockchain**: The proof is stored on the Solana blockchain for verification
4. **Share Verification**: The user can share their verification with third parties via a link or QR code
